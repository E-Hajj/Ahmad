### November 14 2019 (Week 10)
-----------------
created [Progress Report](Electronics).
PCB Version 2 has been soldered.

### November 7 2019 (Week 9)
-----------------
The PCB Design of version one had issues with the current sensor layout. Wires were also place in the wrong position some were supposed to be on the top and some where supposed to be at the bottom so they have a proper connection to the sockets.
Version 2 of PCB has been made created [Version 2](Electronics/Version%202). And Hast also been sent to the prototype lab and will be soldered.
